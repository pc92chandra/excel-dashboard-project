 #Vrinda store annual sales report using Excel


**Objective** : To provide a comprehensive overview of sales performance over the past year, including key metrics, trends, and achievements to facilitate strategic decision making, identify areas of improvement and track progress towards sales growth.     

The dataset included key information such as order ID, customer ID, gender, age, date, status, channel, SKU, category, size, quantity, currency, amount, and shipping city. With the objective of creating an annual sales report, I embarked on a journey to explore this data and extract meaningful insights.

Here's a glimpse of the steps involved in this analysis

â€¢	Data cleaning
â€¢	Data processing
â€¢	Data analysis
â€¢	Design interactive dashboard.

**Insights:**

â€¢	March records the highest sales based on both sales and order views.
â€¢	In 2022, women made more purchases compared to men. (~65%)
â€¢	A significant portion, around 92%, of ordered items were successfully delivered.
â€¢	The top three states contributing to the highest sales are Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. (~35%)
â€¢	Sales predominantly come from adults (30-49 yrs.), with women being the primary purchasers in 2022.
â€¢	Amazon accounts for a substantial portion, approximately 35%, of total sales, indicating its potential significance in revenue growth strategies.

**Conclusion:**

To improve its sales the store must prioritize targeting female customers of the age group (30-49 years) residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh by utilizing advertisements, coupons and discounts, offers, and other value-added services available on Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart. The store must analyze the situations where they are encountering order cancellations, refunds, and order return requests from their customers
